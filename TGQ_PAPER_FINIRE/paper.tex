The 19-parameters realisation of the phenomenological minimal supersymmeric standard model (pMSSM) studied by the ATLAS collaboration in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06608}{arXiv:1508.06608} can also be efficiently constrained by means of simplified models results, as recently shown in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09036}{arXiv:1707.09036}.  The addition of efficiency maps results (EMs), produced with recasting tools, to the official results published by the ATLAS and CMS help increase the number fo escluded points.

\section{Introduction}
( ... )
A comparison between the coverage of the pMSSM by means of simplified model results was originaly presented in \cite{Ambrogi:2017lov}. In particular, the set of pMSSM points considered were made public by the ATLAS collaboration on the \texttt{HepData} website\cite{ATLASpMSSMhepdata}, and the ATLAS experiment's sensitivity of Run 1 searches for SUSY and other more exotic signatures was extensively discussed in \cite{2015baa}. In particular it was analised the fraction of pMSSM points that the ATLAS searches culd excluded accoridng to the nature of the LSP, i.e. Bino, Higgsino and Wino-like LSP. 
The total coverage obtained by the previous \SMO~study amounted to roughly 55$\%$-63$\%$ for the Bino and Higgsino-like LSP case, respectively. The Wino-like LSP dataset was neglected since most of the model pointed included long-lived charged particles, a signature which could not be handled by the version of the \SMO~software used. The work also showed that by means of efficiency maps (EM) results, particularly produced by phenomenologists outside the experimental collaborations, it was possible to increase the number of excluded point.
\\


The comparison between the \SMO~approach and the re-interpretation performed by the ATLAS collaboration, based on a full recast approach, showed that the main limitation of the simplified model approach is the lack of results for simple signatures, such as the 3jets +\MET~. One of the \SMO~tool main features is indeed the ability of extracting the most relevant signatures in terms of $\sigma \times BR$ (production cross section  times branching ratio) that are not currently constrained by simplified models results, called \textit{missing topologies}. The aforementioned signature can arise, for example, from gluino-squark associated production, where the gluino decays preferentially to an on-shell lighter squark, in turn decaying to a jet and the LSP. This simplified model can be fully described by three mass parameters of the sparticle involved: $m_{\tilde g}, m_{\tilde q}$ and $m_{\tilde \chi _1 ^0}$. Under the simplified model assumption, results for such model can be used to constrain the alternative mass hierarchy where the squark is heavier than the gluino, so that this time the squark decays to on-shell gluino. The gluino can then decay radiatively to a gluon and the LSP or via an off-shell squark (i.e. 3-body decay, producing a 4jets + $E_T ^{miss}$ signature ), depending on its mass difference with the lightest squark. 
\\

The idea at the basis of this paper is to extend further the previous study of the coverage of the pMSSM, and concretely show how the inclusion of newly created EM for the 3jets + \MET~signature increases the coverage of the pMSSM. This can be efficiently done by combining the information obtained with \SMO~, which extracts the important missing topologies, and the usage of analyses recasting tools to produce EMs results for arbitrary simplified models, to be implemented in the database of experimental results. For this purpose, this paper is structured as follows: in Section \ref{sec::setup} the set up of the analysis is described, with special emphasis on the production of the EMs and the choice of the mass hierarchy ... 

\section{Analysis of the 3 jets + $E_T ^{miss}$ Signature }\label{sec::T3GQ}
In generic pMSSM-19 points, the squark mass parameters are: 
\begin{equation*}
m_{\tilde u_L} = m_{\tilde d_L} = m_{\tilde c_L} = m_{\tilde s_L} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
m_{\tilde u_R} = m_{\tilde c_R} 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
m_{\tilde d_R} = m_{\tilde s_R}
\end{equation*}
\\
Since the mass of the gluinos is another free parameter, there are two possible mass hierarchies of interest. 
When considering for simplicity the lightest of the squark masses with $m_{\tilde g} > min(m_{\tilde q})$ (and the other third generation squark set to a high scale), gluino will decay almost entirely to an on-shell intermediate squark, followed by the decay of the squark to the LSP:
\begin{equation}\label{decay_TGQ}
\tilde g \rightarrow \tilde q q , \tilde q \rightarrow q \tilde \chi_1 ^0
\end{equation}

\\
However, for the alternative hierarchy where the squark considered is heavier than the gluino,  $ min(m_{\tilde q}) > m_{\tilde g}$ the squarks will decay to an on-shell intermediate gluino. The gluino will then decay either via radiative decay to the LSP as 
\begin{equation}\label{decay_TQG}
\tilde q \rightarrow \tilde g q , \tilde g \rightarrow g \chi_1 ^0
\end{equation} 

\\
or, for small $\Delta (min(m_{\tilde q}), m_{\tilde g})$,  via a three-body decay from off-shell squark:
\begin{equation}
\tilde q \rightarrow \tilde g q, \tilde g \rightarrow q \bar q \tilde \chi _1 ^0.
 \end{equation}
\\
This last model, that produces a 4-jets "[[[`jet',`jet']],[[`jet'],[`jet']]]" signature, will not be considered in this work. The simplified model of interest of this paper is instead the one described by the experimental signature 3jets + \MET~ in the Decays \ref{decay_TGQ} and \ref{decay_TQG}, or, using \SMO~language, by the \textit{[[[`jet']],[[`jet'],['jet']]]} constrain. This experimental signature can be obtained by considering two different mass hierarchies, which are depicted by the diagrams a) and b) in Fig. \ref{Diagrams}. The former, labelled \textit{T3GQ} represents the case where the gluinos are heavier than the squarks considered, while the latter, labelled \textit{T3QG} represents the opposite case. Depending on the specific pMSSM model point considered, one mass hierarchy or the other can potentially produce this particular signature. According to simplified models assumptions, however, there is no need to distinguish between the two cases, and it should be possible to use efficiencies (and consequently limits) obtained with the choice of one of the hierarchies to constrain both scenarios.

As stated in the introduction, the \textit{T3GQ} model was foud to be the most important missing result for the pMSSM. It is to note, however that, by construction, the \textit{T2} and \textit{T5} models, represented by plots c) and d) of Fig. \ref{Diagrams}, are automatically important when the \textit{T3GQ} model is. In practice, the \textit{T3GQ} model is an asymmetric model composed by one branch from the \textit{T2} and one branch from the \textit{T5} models. Thanks to the usage of EM results, it is thus possible to combine the signals from the $pp \rightarrow \tilde g \tilde g$, $pp \rightarrow \tilde q \tilde q$ and $pp \rightarrow \tilde g \tilde q$ channels. Along with the results from \textit{TGQ}, the power of combining the \textit{T2} and \textit{T5} models will be explored in this work. For completeness, results for the \textit{T2} and \textit{T5} models were already included in the previous release of the database, hence did not appear in the missing topologies list of the original study.

\section{Description of the Analysis Setup}\label{sec::setup}
In this Section we describe the setups of the Monte Carlo production followed by the analysis recasting for the extraxtion of the efficiency maps, followed by the description of the analysis of the constraints on the pMSSM with simplified models with the \SMO~tool.
\subsection{Production of the Efficiency Maps}
The set-up for the production of the Monte Carlo signals is here described. Events at parton level were generated using \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}\cite{2011uj} , and then showered and hadronized using \texttt{Pythia 6.4}\cite{Sjostrand:2006za}. The processes considered for the production of the samples for the simplified model are described in Tab. \ref{mg5_processes}.

\caption{\texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO} processes for the production of the Monte Carlo samples, used to extract the efificency maps. All the processes considered the emission of up to one extra parton. The syntax $\$go \ Q$ is used to avoid the presence of on-shell resonances, represented by intermediate gluino and squarks, and double counting when performing the merging between matrix-element and parton-shower.}
\label{mg5_processes}
\end{table}
%
 The process includes the possiblity of emission of up to one extra parton. The merging between the matrix elements and parton-shower formalisms was performed adopting the $k_T \ jet$ MLM scheme \cite{MLM,Alwall:2007fs}. 
%
The analysis recasting was performed with \texttt{MadAnalysis 5}, using the recasting codes for the analysis ATLAS-SUSY-2013-02\cite{ATLAS-SUSY-2013-02MA5,ATLAS-SUSY-2013-02VALIDATION} and CMS-SUS-13-012\cite{CMS-SUS-13-012MA5,CMS-SUS-13-012VALIDATION}. The tuned version of \texttt{DELPHES 3} integrated in the \texttt{MadAnalysis 5} framework was used to perform the simulate the detector effects on the particle objects. Jets were clustered using \texttt{FastJet}\cite{Cacciari:2011ma}.
%
The description of the grid of mass points defined for the production of the efficiency maps is provided in Tab. \ref{TGQ_Planes}. The analyses chosen for the recasting search for SUSY events in the all hadronic final state, vetoing the presence of isolated leptons. In particular the two above analyses are sensitive to events with small jet multiplicity, as generated by the simplified models considered. Although official EM results for the \textit{T2} model were made public by the collaborations, part of the parameter space with small mass gap between the squark and the LSP is below $~$50 GeV is not properly covered. For this reason, EMs were produced, up to a mass difference as small as 5 GeV between the squarks and the LSP. In addition, also the results for the \Tfive~model were extended to cover scenarios with small mass difference between the gluino-squark and squark-neutralino.

The parameter x is defined so that $m_{\tilde q}= x\cdot m_{\tilde g} + (1-x)\cdot m_{\tilde \chi_1 ^0}$. For the \textit{T3GQ} model, the gluino mass reaches the value of 2 TeV, with a binning of 50 GeV for $200 \leq m_{\tilde g} < 1200$, and a binning of 100 GeV for $1200 \leq m_{\tilde g}  \leq 2000$ GeV. The squark masses have a 50 GeV binning, up to 1 TeV. For a better coverage of the parameter space in the case of small mass differences, additional mass planes parametrized with $\Delta M ( \tilde q, \tilde \chi _1 ^0)$=(5,10,15) GeV were produced. }
\label{TGQ_Planes} 
\end{table}
%
%
The mass hierarchy used for the production of the gluino-squark model is $m_{\tilde g} > m_{\tilde q}$, meaning that the \textit{T3GQ} model was chosen to constrain the "[[[`jet']],[[`jet],[`jet']]]" signature. Note that the same problem related to the choice of the mass hierarchy applies to the $T5$ model: the "[[[`jet']],[[`jet']]]" signature can be obtained both with $\tilde g \rightarrow g \tilde \chi _1 ^0$ and $\tilde q \rightarrow q \tilde \chi _1 ^0$; for the maps production, again the former hierachy was chosen. 



\subsection{SModelS Analysis}
The setup for the analysis with \SMO~follows closely what described originally in \cite{Ambrogi:2017lov}, that is here summarized. The pMSSM-19 model points considered in the analysis are a subset of the points used by the ATLAS collaboration in the re-intepretation study\cite{Aad:2015baa}, and made availbel on \texttt{HepData}\cite{ATLASpMSSMhepdata}. Since the aim of the previous and current \SMO~analysis is to quantify the coverage of the pMSSM parameters space by means of simplified model results only, only the points that could be excluded by SUSY searches at 8 TeV were analysed, and points excluded by searches for exotic particle like long lived charged states and resonances compatible with a Heavy Higgs boson were not included. This selection reduced the original number of points tested by ATLAS from 103,410 to 38,575 (Bino-like LSP dataset) and from 126,684 to 45,594 (Higgsino-like LSP dataset). This identical dataset is being re-analysed, and the improvement in the coverage thanks to the newly added efficiency maps result tested. {\color{red} The Wino-like LSP dataset was not tested, since most of the models included long-lived charginos; note however that form version of \SMO~, it is possible to constrain also these more exotic signatures}.

Version v1.1.1 of \SMO~was employed. The \SMO~cross section calculator, which provides a useful interface with \texttt{Pythia 8}(\texttt{v.8.226})\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}, \texttt{Pythia 6}\cite{Sjostrand:2006za} and \texttt{NLLFast}~\cite{nllfast,Beenakker:1996ch,Kulesza:2008jb,Kulesza:2009kq,Beenakker:2009ha,Beenakker:2011fu,Beenakker:1997ut,Beenakker:2010nq} was used to compute the production cross sections, up to NLO+NLL order for strong production, and LO for electroweak processes; \texttt{Pythia 6}~was instead used for slepton production. The other two relevant parameters selected in the configuration file \texttt{parameters.ini} are the \texttt{sigmacut}= 0.03 fb (controlling the minimum weight, defined as $w = \sigma \times BR$ for each simplified model appearing in the decomposition) and \verb|minmassgap| = 5 GeV, i.e. the minimum mass gap for which the SM products appearing in the decay chain are considered visible.

\section{Extending the pMSSM Coverage}\label{sec::impact}
In this Section we study the improvements in the pMSSM coverage provided by the additional EMs for the \textit{T3GQ} gluino-squark model, in combination with the \textit{T2} and \textit{T5} model. Table \ref{Res_Tab_New} shows the new total exclusion of the pMSSM points. The coverage in the Bino and Higgsino-like case reaches up to 74 and 71 $\%$, with an increase of +19$\%$ and +8$\%$ respectively from the previous work, able to exclude 21,151 and 28,669 model points for the Bino-like and Higgsino-like datasets respectively.

The major improvement appears in the Bino-like LSP case, as visible also in the gluino and squark mass coverage distributions in Fig. \ref{pmssm_new_exclusion_gluino} and \ref{pmssm_new_exclusion_squark}. 
%
It is also interesting to analise the exclusion provided by each Txname result, and the impact of their combination. This is shown in Fig.\ref{combination_gluino} and Fig.\ref{combination_squark}, where the study is done considering the analysis ATLAS-SUSY-2013-02 only.

\subsection{Contribution From The Different Topologies}
As detailed in Section \ref{sec::T3GQ}, the \textit{T2}, \textit{T5} and \textit{T3GQ} can be combined to efficiently reconstruct the signals from $\tilde g \tilde g$, $\tilde q \tilde q$ and $\tilde g \tilde q$ production channels. Here we wish to analyse how the newly excluded points benefit from such combination. We limit to consider only the analysis ATLAS-SUSY-2013-02, that additionally includes EMs for the \textit{T1} model provided by the ATLAS collaboration. The exclusion provided by each model and by the combination of the $T2+T5+T3GQ$ are drawn in Fig. \ref{combination_gluino} and \ref{combination_squark}, for the analysis ATLAS-SUSY-2013-02 only. Note that points can be excluded by more than one results, e.g. points with both light squarks and gluinos, with $m_{\tilde g} > m_{tilde q}$, might be excluded by both the \textit{T2} and \textit{T5} results.

\section{Comparison with 13 TeV Results}
%
In general it is believed that the latest results from the LHC experiments, obtained with data collected at 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy, provide better limits with respect the analogous results obtained by previous 8 TeV searches. Besides an improvmeent in the collision energy, recent searches are also based on larger dataset, due to a large integrated luminosity wrt Run 1. In the context of simplified models, however, such belief is not totally justified, depending primarily on the type of simplified model that are used for the interpretation of the searches. Besides few results provided by the ATLAS collaboration, see e.g. , in the form of efificnecy maps, only upper limit results are available, relative to limited variety of simplified models. It is interesting then to investigate if there are pMSSM points that can be excluded at 8 TeV thanks to the \TGQ~homegrown results, but that survive 13 TeV constraints with the available simplified models. Table \ref{13_TeV} summarises the number of points that cannot be excluded with 13 TeV results.

\section{T3GQ vs T3QG Upper Limits}
The following Tables \ref{ATLAS02_UL} and \ref{ATLAS02_UL_2}  compare the upper limits obtained for the mass point ($M_1,M_2,M_3) = (1000,200,190),(1200,600,500)$ [GeV] for the two different hierarchy models \textit{T3GQ}($m_{\tilde g}, m_{\tilde q}, m_{\tilde \chi _1 ^0 }$) and \textit{T3QG}($m_{\tilde q}, m_{\tilde g}, m_{\tilde \chi _1 ^0 }$). In bold, the best SR providing the strongest expected limit and corresponding observed limit is shown. The difference in the efficiency and consequent choice of a different SR, respectively \textit{2jm} for \textit{T3GQ} and \textit{2jt} for \textit{T3QG}, favours a strongest limit for the \textit{T3GQ} case. However the difference is contained within a factor 2, which translates to only few tens of GeV difference in the excluded mass of Squarks or Gluinos.
