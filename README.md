***


This repository contains all the informations and scripts to produce the data for the update
of the pMSSM study with the new TGQ efficiency maps

The OLD results (first publication) are contained in TGQ_old.
From the two files, the names of the SLHA used to be used for the analyses are extracted,
This list does not contain the SLHA that could be constrained by ATLAS by the searches for heavy Higgs
(and that were not considered in the first paper)

Bino     = 38575 
Higgsino = 45595
